Breadth First Search aka Level Order Traversing

Level Order Traversal or Bredth First Search technique is defined as a method to traverse a Tree such that all nodes present in the same level are traversed completely before traversing the next level.

How does Level Order Traversal work?
  The main idea of level order traversal is to traverse all the nodes of a lower level before moving to any of the nodes of a higher level. This can be done in any of the following ways: 
  1. the naive one (finding the height of the tree and traversing each level and printing the nodes of that level)
  2. efficiently using a queue.

Code:
class Tree {
  constructor(value, left, right) {
    this.value = value
    this.left = left
    this.right = right
  }
}

const breadthFirstTraversal = (tree, callback) => {
  if (tree == null) {
    return;
  }

  let queue = [tree]

  while (queue.length > 0) {
    let item = queue.shift()
    let value = item.value
    callback(value)

    if (item.left == null && item.right == null) {
      continue
    }
    if (item.left != null) {
      queue.push(item.left)
    }
    if (item.right != null) {
      queue.push(item.right)
    }
  }
}

t = new Tree(1,
      new Tree(2, null, null), new Tree(3,
        new Tree(4, null, null), null))

breadthFirstTraversal(t, console.log)
// Will print "1,2,3,4"
