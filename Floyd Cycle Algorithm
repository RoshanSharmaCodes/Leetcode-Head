Floyd Cycle Detection (To Detect Cycle in Graph or Linked List)

Also know as Tortoise and Rabbit Method.

Floydâ€™s cycle finding algorithm or Hare-Tortoise algorithm is a pointer algorithm that uses only two pointers, moving through the sequence at different speeds. 
This algorithm is used to find a loop in a linked list. 
It uses two pointers one moving twice as fast as the other one. The faster one is called the fast pointer and the other one is called the slow pointer.

While traversing the linked list one of these things will occur-

The Fast pointer may reach the end (NULL) this shows that there is no loop in the linked list.
The Fast pointer again catches the slow pointer at some time therefore a loop exists in the linked list.

Code:
   
        // JavaScript code for the above approach 
        class Node
        {
            constructor(d) 
            {
                this.data = d;
                this.next = null;
            }
        }
 
        // initialize a new head for the linked list
        let head = null;
 
        // detect if there is a loop
        // in the linked list
        function detectLoop(head) {
            let slowPointer = head;
            let fastPointer = head;
 
            while (slowPointer != null
                && fastPointer != null
                && fastPointer.next != null) {
                slowPointer = slowPointer.next;
                fastPointer = fastPointer.next.next;
                if (slowPointer == fastPointer)
                    return 1;
            }
 
            return 0;
        }
 
        // inserting new values
        head = new Node(10);
        head.next = new Node(20);
        head.next.next = new Node(30);
        head.next.next.next = new Node(40);
        head.next.next.next.next = new Node(50);
 
        // adding a loop for the sake
        // of this example
        let temp = head;
        while (temp.next != null)
            temp = temp.next;
 
        temp.next = head;
 
        // loop added;
        if (detectLoop(head))
            document.write("Loop exists in the Linked List" + "<br>");
        else
            document.write("Loop does not exists in the Linked List" + "<br>");
