Selection Sort

Intution:
Selection sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element 
from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list. 

Code:
function selectionSort(arr,  n) 
{ 
    var i, j, min_idx; 
  
    // One by one move boundary of unsorted subarray 
    for (i = 0; i < n-1; i++) 
    { 
        // Find the minimum element in unsorted array 
        min_idx = i; 
        for (j = i + 1; j < n; j++) 
        if (arr[j] < arr[min_idx]) 
            min_idx = j; 
  
        // Swap the found minimum element with the first element 
        swap(arr,min_idx, i); 
    } 
}
